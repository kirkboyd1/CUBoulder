Introduction:

In this report, we analyze the NYPD Shooting Incident dataset to uncover insights regarding shooting
incidents in New York City. We will visualize trends over the years and analyze the demographics of
individuals involved in these incidents.

Biases and Conclusions :


There are a few types of biases we could potentially identify:

Geographic Bias: Some areas ( certain boroughs or neighborhoods) may have higher rates of shootings due to population density, police presence, or historical social factors. This could bias our model.

Temporal Bias: Certain periods ( holidays, specific years) might see more shootings due to various factors ( events), which could influence model predictions if not accounted for properly.

Gender Bias: The data may contain gender imbalances ( more incidents involving males), which could influence predictions of who is involved in shootings.


Conclusions :
The dataset offers crucial insights into the behavioral patterns, the victims, the race, locations etc, which may offer valuable insights for policy changes over time.

We can conclude that Bronx has the highest chance of getting shot per person compared to the other boroughs in New York City. Staten Island has the lowest chance of getting shot per person. However, itâ€™s important to note that the difference in shooting rates between the boroughs is not very large, with the highest rate being only slightly above 0.5% and the lowest rate being just over 0.15%.

Based on the linear regression results, we can conclude that there is a positive relationship between the number of shooting incidents and the population size in each borough. In other words, as the population size increases, the number of shooting incidents tends to increase as well.


**We must always look for more insights because :
  Correlation does not imply causation and there may be other factors that contribute to the number of shooting incidents beyond just population size.!!
